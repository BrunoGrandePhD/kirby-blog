Text: This is a quick biography I wrote about myself for an upcoming project. I'm incredibly excited to get started with it. Hint: the blog mention isn't referring to the one you're reading right now.

> Bruno is just another one of those over-polite Canadians, currently working on his Master's degree at Simon Fraser University near Vancouver, Canada. He started at the same time in the same lab as his co-blogger, Kevin, under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Morin. Bruno's research focuses primarily on the bioinformatics of cancer genomics. In other words, he does the computer stuff required for analyzing tumour DNA. Essentially, he's looking for genetic changes that are linked to cancer. Knowing these changes can then allow for the development of preventive and therapeutic medicine.

> He was born and raised for the first 22 years of his life in Montreal, Canada. Although initially interested in technology, his aspirations became geared towards biomedical research after his father succumbed to <a title="Oligodendroglioma" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodendroglioma" target="_blank">brain cancer</a> when he was 14. Towards the end of his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry at McGill University, he eventually realized that he still held a passion for computer science. The existence of the growing field of bioinformatics seemed too good an opportunity to miss. So, he seized it and moved across the country in pursuit of his ambitions!

> His hopes for this blog include doing his part to close the <a title="The Science Gap - Jorge Cham" href="http://youtu.be/AzcMEwAxSP8?t=2m9s" target="_blank">science gap</a>. In particular, there's no denying that cancer is a complex disease that plagues <a title="Global Cancer Facts and Figures" href="http://www.cancer.org/research/cancerfactsstatistics/global" target="_blank">millions of people</a> worldwide in addition to their family and friends. Yet, how much do we know about cancer? Certainly not everything, and arguably, not even close. Nonetheless, the life sciences have made remarkable progress over the past few decades in elucidating the ins and outs of cancer. And so he wishes to convey this information in a format and vernacular accessible to all.
