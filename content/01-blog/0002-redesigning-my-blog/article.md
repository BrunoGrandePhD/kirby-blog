Text: After more than a year with the previous iteration, I finally redesigned my blog. I've been meaning to improve a few things, but eventually decided to overhaul the whole thing. No more sidebar. Bigger and better typography. Added personality. More thoughtful articles, hopefully. 

As always, I seek as much feedback as I can get. Let me know what you don't like rather than what you like. I assume what you don't comment on is good as is. Send me a tweet using the link below or [email me](mailto:contact@brunogrande.me) with the critique. Thank you in advance.
