I entirely agree with the author’s argument. I find myself avoiding making points for the sake of diplomacy, since I don’t want to stir up conflict. I've always taken pride in being affable, and I often get the impression that being direct would make it difficult to maintain my reputation of being friendly. However, as the above article clearly demonstrates, this diplomatic approach tends to be unhelpful and hinders whatever is the task at hand. 

While the blog post explores the impacts on business, the idea remains true for all other aspects that you might encounter. At school, at work, with family and friends, in a relationship. We should all strive to improve ourselves. Moreover, I believe being direct should be a duty in any interpersonal relationship, however professional or intimate, assuming you want the other person’s wellbeing. 

There’s no denying this isn’t easy. As I mentioned, I find it particularly difficult given my diplomatic nature. While you might be unsure as to who would be receptive to feedback, you can make it clear to others that you actively seek it. In fact, you should solicit constructive criticism whenever the opportunity presents itself. Elon Musk, founder of PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors, [gives this very advice](http://youtu.be/L-s_3b5fRd8?t=21m2s) (at 21:02). 

So, the take-home message is simply to be more direct. If ever you find yourself avoiding making a point in order to avoid conflict, does it really help others? Most likely, you’re either delaying the inevitable, or you’re preventing someone from becoming a better person, both of which are undesirable. Also, a good starting point is to seek out negative feedback and convincing others to do the same. Hopefully, this will lead to a world more open to criticism, a world actively trying to improve itself.
