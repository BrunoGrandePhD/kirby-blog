## Education

I'm still a student, more specifically a Master's student. My research is done at Simon Fraser University near Vancouver, Canada, under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Morin. Essentially, my project consists of integrating cancer genomics tools into user-friendly workflows and perform cancer analyses of my own, looking for driver mutations (the ones that cause cancer). Previously, I've completed my undergraduate studies at McGill University in my hometown of Montreal, Canada. My major was Biochemistry Honours and I also completed a Minor in Management.

## Biomedical Research

As it should be clear from my education, I have an interest in science. I've always preferred science in school, especially biology and chemistry, in that order. So, it's not a surprise that I ended up doing my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry. Apart from science, I do appreciate epistemology, the theory of knowledge. I find the means of acquiring knowledge, in addition to their advantages and shortcomings, fascinating. It highlights the importance of critical thinking, an aptitude I strongly believe everyone should possess.

## Software Development

My first experience with programming was with a graphic calculator in high school. I remember enjoying the process of writing conditional statements to evaluate what to do next. Jump ahead to the outset of my undergraduate studies, when I took an introduction to programming class. This is where I really noticed how much I enjoy programming. Eventually, I consolidated both of my passions, programming and biomedical research, and settled on bioinformatics for my graduate studies (technically, cancer genomics). For now, my language of choice is Python.

## Design

I'm no designer. However, I believe in good design and in the fact that the latter doesn't merely consist of making things pretty. If I make something that others might use, even if it doesn't have a graphical user interface, I want to ensure that its usability is optimal. I've come to know that I'm unable to design icons or decide on colour palettes. On the other hand, I get by with layouts, user interactions and I nitpick on details that I believe amount to a better user experience. I wouldn't say I have a creative genius, but with enough time, I can iterate and improve a product's design, or at least I hope.
